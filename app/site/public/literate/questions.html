    If I want to write private notes in the same place that I write public
    things, I'll need to solve. If I put private things into Git, for example,
    how can I hide those things?

    What kind of tools can make authoring HTML easier?

    There are so many difficulties in writing pure HTML to account for:

    * Tags require a lot of typing
    * Prose interspersed with tags is hard to read
    * Compliant HTML is hard to get right
    * To maintain a website's consistency requires updates to be replicated in many places
    * My text editor (Doom Emacs) is not the best for authoring HTML

    Even as I write these first pages and words in my new effort, I am writing in Markdown and trusting that I will find
    some tool to ease the transition.
