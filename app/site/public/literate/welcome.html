    If the index page were a doormat, this must be the front entrance.

    Take off your shoes and coat. Shake off your public face and prepare to enjoy some company.

    This site is an easy place to be. It might be difficult to navigate, but moving always takes energy. Anyone who
    tells you different wants to sell you an escape from reality.

    You can use your browser's back button to leave this page. I know you knew that, but you hadn't tried it yet.
