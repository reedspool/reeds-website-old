    This is an HTML index page. Also called a home page. Also called a landing page.

    The URL in your browser window may not say <code>index.html</code>. But if it doesn't, you can add that
    to the end and see this same page. Probably.

    I wonder why these are called home pages. I hang out in my home. I sleep there. I don't think I've ever slept on an
    Internet home page, but on the other hand I've slept in some strange places.

    Maybe a more apt name would be "doormat page", as mostly I want you to step through it to get somewhere more
    interesting.

    Doormats often give a sense of the humor of the home beyond. I'd imagine you're sensing this site's humor is dull
    and rambling.

    Here are some places you could go:

    * [Welcome](welcome.html)
    * [Why](why.html)
    * [Questions](questions.html)

    Pages like this one are also called index pages because indexes in books and libraries are tools to get to the
    information or
    resource you want. I could use an index in my home; maybe then I could find that hat...
