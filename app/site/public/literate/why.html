    I decided to start writing HTML.

    To be specific, I want to author in HTML. It seems daunting. All the tags and syntax for even the simplest prose
    layout.

    Contrast this with templating languages like PHP which add non-HTML
    compatible syntax to super charge websites with the bleeding edge of 90s tech. Another contrast is modern "Content
    Management Systems" which encourage authoring in separate files and text boxes. Markdown was made to ease the
    trouble I placed myself in with this project.

    A number of signals led me to this choice. One was reading The Overstory.
    Another was reading The Timeless Way of Building. Another was learning about
    HTMX and Hyperscript. Another is using Emacs and Org-mode. Through org-mode,
    I found literate programming, and what better tool is there for publishing
    to a wide audience?

    HTML was made the month I was born. I grew up with it, and it with me. Of
    course the rest of the world also grew into it. But I can't speak for them.

    I'd like to spend time investing in HTML. That will mean investing in modern
    tools for authoring and maintaining it. And time with CSS to present it
    nicely to myself and others.

    Separate from my journey to how I got here, I can talk about what problems
    it solves for me. What frictions does it smooth out? What forces in my life
    does it resolve?

    I write a lot of prose inside structured environments. I fill in lots of
    input boxes and text fields on websites. When I write notes for myself, I
    write in Org-mode or markdown (I recently switched from org-mode to Obsidian
    for notes at work, because more people and interfaces readily accept
    markdown than org-mode).
