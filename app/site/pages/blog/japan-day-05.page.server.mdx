I woke up, showered, and headed for the Hakodate Morning Market for breakfast. I found a hole in the wall and had a bowl of uni (sea urchin), salmon roe, and scallops over rice with pickled vegetables and miso soup. I also had some green tea. It was really, really good. Salty and delicious.

I strolled through the market some more and bought some dried scallops in a tube of plastic. Will report.

I got on the street car and headed for Cape Tachimachi. A 15 minute hike along the coast against a vantage of the lush green coast on one side, and the quiet-but-full Hakodate bay on the other. The walk up was especially nice through a beautiful, well-kept cemetary.

I stayed there for an hour while  I planned my next  step. I couldn't think of much else to do in Hakodate so I looked north to Sapporo. Then I realized I had the train pass, so I could take as many trips as I wanted. I looked at the stops along the way to Sapporo and found a spot with 2 big lakes. A review said it was easy to rent a bike to bike around the lake.

So I went straight there. I got off the train, saw a bike rental and got one immediately. There was a big basket on this cruiser type bike that fit my backpack and front pack perfectly. I set off and almost immediately stopped at a serene outlet to the shore of the lake. It was gorgeous with an active volcano on the other side. As I kept biking, I saw crows and a giant hawk. I almost hit a crow that launched out of a bush near my bike tire just as I passed it. 

There were adorable fox drawings on street signs. Suddenly in front of me on the sidewalk was a family of foxes playing. I let them play until they scampered off and I could continue.

The bike was not made for someone my size, so the uphill portions were difficult. I was grateful for the exercise that wasn't high impact on my feet though, since they were still sore. 

I still had no place to stay that night so I walked in to a hotel next to the train station and asked for a room. I paid in cash and went to lay down for an hour.

When I got up, I was hungry, so I went downstairs to find a place to eat. I foud all the doors on the first floor, inside and out. There was a sign saying the owner was done working for the day and some instructions for what to do if you wanted to go out, but I didn't understand the Google Lens translation. I wrote a note in english and went out.

The only restaurant Google Maps said was open was an Izakaya a 5 minute walk down the road. But when I got there, the owner shoed me away saying they were closed. There was a 7-11 another 15 minute walk down the road, but I was afraid I'd get locked out of my hotel. So I went back. The owner was just reading my note when I returned in his pajamas, and he was grateful I was back so he could lock back up. 

I ate the dried scallops. They were like jerky, but scallops. Really tasty!

I read for a while and fell asleep on the small, hard mattress. I was too tired to think about comfort.
