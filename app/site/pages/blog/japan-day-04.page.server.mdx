I crawled out of my capsule sore and happy. I slowly got dressed and packed and stumbled to check out. 

I searched for where to go. I hadn't ended up going through central Shibuya yesterday, since I spent all my wandering time in Harajuku. 

I needed to do laundry, so I picked somewhere close to Shibuya station. I got breakfast and coffee in a minimart where I had to buy laundry detergent anyways. Except it turned out I didn't need it since the machines automatically put in a detergent. I considered how wild it would be in the US if a laundromat picked which detergent and how much to put in for you. The laundry detergent lobby would never allow it.

Laundry was painless, however there was no place to "chill" while I got it done. I ended up sitting on a ledge on the street for the hour, feeling the eyes of the 8am commuters. No one said anything. I packed my clean clothes, organized my bag, and set off for the train station.

At Shibuya station I saw a bunch of white people waiting in line. It turned out the JR Rail Pass counter was about to open. I decided to get in line as someone mentioned the pass to me last night. I didn't do any math about how many train rides I planned to take. Nor did I make any conversion to how much USD it would cost me to buy the business class ("green") pass instead of the standard one. I just pulled the trigger. The staff were helpful and patient. They got me the pass I needed, and showed me how to use the machine to reserve a seat on the Shinkansen to Hakodate that afternoon.

With new knowledge and a new pass, I set off to Omiya on the city train where my Shinkansen would depart in a couple hours. I had an hour at Omiya so I walked around the shopping mall next to the station and bought some food.

Boarding the Shinkansen was simple. I oggled at the ticket gate which took both my JR Pass and my reserved seat ticket at the same time, stacked on top of each other, read them both, then spit them both out together and opened the gate.

The train departed and continued quickly. I watched the moutains and the towns zoom by for hours. 

The only notable thing which happened on the train was that I went to use the restroom, and I hit the button for the automatic sliding door. I saw an old man standing peeing, though he didn't notice me. I tried to hit the door close button but I had to wait seconds for it to complete opening and then to close again. Then a woman came and tried to do the same thing and I had to wave her away.

When I left the train station, I felt the different climate. Breezy, not so muggy. Salt in the air. I had to take one more train from the Shinkansen stop to Hakodate proper and one was leaving immediately.

In Hakodate I stopped at the train station to find a hotel. I found a cheap one, a Japanese-style room (tatami mats and futon mattress) with a shared bathroom, called the Pension Puppy Tail. 

I walked around the coast where some people were fishing, but my feet were still tired so I headed for the inn. I checked in and nearly passed out, but I decided to try and stay awake by finding some food. I embarassed myself by not knowing how to order, but the staff were patient with me. I got Izakaya sashimi and some stewed fish with a lot of bones. Still it was delicious. Then I passed out and had a full night of sleep, finally, without waking up too early.
