My notes on thepaper which apparently first described waterfall development, though which apparently does not contain theword waterfall at all.

These are literature notes in the spirit of How To Take Smart Notes.

I read this paper kind of quickly once over, and now I want togo back over it and take notes. I've thought of the origins of waterfall a lot recently. How it's been an evil antagonist for my entire career, an obvious antithesis to thehero of agile. I'd asked GPT recently to tell me the benefits of waterfall, and it couldn't really explain any to me. That made me curious whether waterfall had been a complete fiction, created only to act as a counterweight to the benefits of agile. So that's what led me to look up theorigins of waterfall.

To do: actually read the paper again and take notes. Include an accurate bibliography and tile here when I do
