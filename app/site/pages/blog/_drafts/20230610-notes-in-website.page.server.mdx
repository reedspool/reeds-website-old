I want to take notes in the same system in which I make my website.

In Jobs To Be Done terms, I want to level up as a person to publish more of my ideas.

From How To Take Smart Notes, I want my notes in the same system in which I write, because note takingand writing are the same activity. Or rather research is writing and research is note taking.

From Atomic Habits, I want to lower the friction in order to make this a more automatic habit.

Obviously, when I write my notes in the same system as my blog pages, I will be most of the way to publishing my notes. I have some minor anxiety about this. Many people publish their thoughts constantly on social media. I don't do this, but that's what it feels like I'd be doing. I'm certainly overthinking this. Nobody will be reading my notes with a careful eye looking to judge me for my views. And even if they were, I might like to get some feedback on thse views, if there is anything to judge unfavorably.

There are many frictions to switching systems like this.

For one, I will probably not commit much time to systematically moving over my existing notes. This feels like losing all that work, but the truth is I was not really utilizing them. I already have other past systems of notes which are lying dormant, untouched for up to a decade.

Another friction in shifting over is that I will leave all the tools and tricks I had for note taking behind. Emacs org-mode and org-roam gave me so many tools. If I want to use those tools, I'll have to rebuild them myself. But agagain, I wasn't utilizing those tools to their maximum potential, so the loss seems greater than it truly is. 

And I'll be able to recognize what's missing and take my time importing notes and reimplementing tools. 

What's the worst case? I have some thoughts in a system I don't want to use anymore. Who cares. Life's too short.
