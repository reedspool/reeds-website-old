Literature notes (a la How to Take Smart Notes) for "The Klutz Book of Card Games for Sharks & Others"

I'd had recent conversations with Jordan and Brian about how we didn't know many fun card games with just a normal deck of cards. We'd mentioned Hoyle's, a book that I'm familiar with. When I saw this book in a little, local free library (one of those cabinets in themiddle of a random neighborhood), I grabbed it.

The origins of playing cards is unknown, however their popularity can be attributed to a Franciscan Friar, Saint Bernard of Siena, who said in a sermon that Satan was thesource of playing cards and card games. Thus everyone's interest was piqued. pg 2

This book is copyright 1990 by John Cassidy (the same? There's a juggler by that name who used to perform at the magic summer camp I attended). It contains a boringly racist depiction of Native Americans and boldly calls them Indians. I've heard many Indians accept that term today (reclaiming? Just don't care? Don't know). But I can't imagine Klutz having ths kind of awareness. pg 3

War is described. A novelty I donvort remember ever playing with is that when a War is initiated each player first puts down a face down card. Then you judge the next card. And if that is also a tie, then each lays down two face down cards and so on. That adds more stakes to each war as well as some hidden information. Mystery, but War is still autonomous, no player control, so there's no tactics for which this could imperfect information could be app tied usefully. pg 10.

Also interesting in a game of 3 to remove one random card from thedeck before dividing it, because 51 is divisible by 3. pg 10

Also in three player War, if all 3 players match, you immediately go to "double war" with 2 face down cards. This makes the game mechanics heighten the tension at a natural point that is already exciting and novel for the human players. I like this idea of a mechanic heightening when the humans would already be heightened. A ind of like a multiplictave effect. pg 10
