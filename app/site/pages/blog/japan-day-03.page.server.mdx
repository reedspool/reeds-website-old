I woke up at 2am as if that was normal. That's 10am my Pacific so I guess it makes sense. I had the general sensation of a bunch of internal clocks misaligned, like there had been a series of small power outages and my appliances had all begun blinking "12:00" at different hours. I was hungry but sleepy but also wired and ready to get on with it. I stayed in bed in protest for a couple more hours, drifting between wide awake and passed out cold. 

Then I opened the blackout curtains at 6am to daylight and made coffee in the little pod machine.

My clothes weren't dry after many hours when it was time to check out. Grateful I didn't make the dumb choice to only bring a couple pairs of underwear and socks, but I did end up putting on a damp shirt. 

I still didn't know where I would head. I spent the morning hours thinking and researching, but I couldn't decide whether to go north where it is cooler, or south where I've heard that there are more cool things to see in general. But north or south, I was going to get on the train to Tokyo central station. And when I did that, I made a bad decision to try to go at rush hour when everyone crushes and packs together to fit. I waited for a couple trains before I decided I was definitely going to get on the next one. But that one turned out to be a luxury car of some sort because there were nicer seats and much fewer people on board.

I still hadn't decided if I would head north or south when I got to Tokyo central station so I decided to walk around the outside of the station. There was a tour group outside and the guide repeated a vehement gesture at the architecture of the station.

I was right next to the Imperial Palace which was a thought on the list of activities my friend and I might do together. So I thought I'd check it out. When I got to blockaded entrance, I learned that it was closed on most Mondays in the summer, including this one. 

Since I was already in Tokyo, I decided to look for things to do there first. That led me to search for an Ultimate pickup game. I found one a half-hour train ride away, in Shibuya. I had 8 hours to kill until the game, so I decided to get there and then look around for local sights. And Meiji Jingu jumped out on the map. On my way I decided I was finally ready to eat something, so I stopped at a small hole-in-the wall ramen shop just outside the park. The host helpfully pulled out a picture menu and I pointed at the Green Onion Ramen. It was amazing. The salt of the broth was life-saving in the heat. 

Then some fellow tourists beside me tried to pay with a card. "Cash only," said the server. So they tried to pay with a 20 US Dollar bill. The cook said "cash machine next door." So one of them went to find it. They came back five minutes later with no Yen, and the cook decided to shoe them away. They were taking up valuable seats. I took 3000 Yen, roughly 20 USD out of my pocket and wordlessly offered to exchange them for their bill. They took me up on it, paid, and left. I went back to my food, finished, paid, and left. When I finished, I briefly joked about paying with the same 20, to which the cook had a giggle (I was nervous about that one). When I got out the door a man followed me out and called to me in Japanese. I shook my head. Then he handed me 2 coins, 150 yen. I gave him my best confused look. He explained, "1 dollar, 142 yen". He meant I had given the too much, by a few yen. I laughed and thanked him. 

The shrine was interesting and nice to walk around. I learned from the posters that it was the resting place of the emperor who modernized Japan. I "paid my respects" as a poster instructed, with two bows, two claps, and then a final bow. I watched and listened to the massive drum beat which you can hear throughout the park. I enjoyed the garden and the lilly pond. My favorite part was the incredibly large Torii (gate) next to the shrine. It's really big.

After the shrine, I kept moving towards the Ultimate game. Just south of the shrine was Harajuku, a neighborhood I had heard of, but couldn't remember why. but upon entering it was obvious: its the instagrammable influencer haven.

Many wild shops with designer everything. If Hot Topic and Claire's had a baby, or something.

There was a big Uniqlo. I got pants and two shirts, and donated two old shirts and a sweater that I felt confident I would not miss in the heat. The 30 dollar upgrade felt great, and I was grateful I could lighten my load with a donation bin instead of a trash bin. 

I went to another shrine by accident as I strolled through the neighborhood. Then I stumbled into Design Festa Gallery, a place my had pointed out while we planned. I wished I had more energy to hang out and explore all the rooms.

I kept walking another half hour to Ultimate and I still needed food in my spare hour before the game. I found a sushi spot. I was the only one in the restaurant and I felt the eyes on me. But the sushi chef and the waiter were kind. And the sushi was really good. It was so fresh, the perfect treat for about $10.

Ultimate was very fun and exhausting. Everyone there was very athletic and skilled. I had been walking all day but even if I hadn't, they all would have outrun me easily. My feet hurt before I even began, and by the end I thought they'd burn up in a firey blaze. There were Japanese natives, a handful of Americans, and one person from Taiwan. 

I left for my hotel exhausted and happy. The 10 minute walk became a 15 minute hobble, and it felt like ages on my dead feet. 

It was a capsule hostel. I chose it because I knew I'd be dead tired, and physically worn out after the game. I showered and wore the provided pajamas, as I only had one clean outfit left and I'd need to wear it to the laundromat. I climbed into my little capsule at 10pm. I couldn't pull the little curtain down completely, because it was too deathly hot without the AC from the room flowing in. So I was glad I brought an eye mask. I woke up at 2am to stomping and shuffling, but I expected this because all the reviews for the hotel pointed out there was no sound barrier in the packed dorm. I woke up again at 6am to someone's alarm. I was so elated to be on a normal Japan sleep schedule I was happy to get up and start the day.
