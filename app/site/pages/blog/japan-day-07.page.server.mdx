I checked out of my hotel and got on the bus for Moerenuma Park on the outskirts of Sapporo.

I didn't know anything about the park when I decided to go, except the brief descriptions and reviews on Google Maps. 

I learned in the gallery space that the park designer was Izuma Noguchi. The park was his last project, and they built it after he passed away. I realized I might have heard of this park in Chrisopher Alexander's book, Timeless Way of Building. I could feel the similar inspiration. It was a big park, full of grass with odd topography and large sculptures all around. I saw another hawk of the same type as in Onuma. I sat and read the books in the gallery for a bit, and learned a little about the designer. The books were full of photos of awesome artwork by him and his contemporaries. I liked his Akari lanterns. A work called "Self Portrait" that was a mess of brush strokes and kanji. It was by one of Noguchi's friends, but I can't recall his name just now. I thought about what my self portrait would look like in the medium I use most, HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm a nerd.

I happened to be just in time for a water show in a big fountain that I couldn't take my eyes off, especially during the section titled "Big Wave". I never thought I'd stare at a water fountain for 40 minutes.

I sat in the high grass under the trees around the fountain and found all my things suddenly covered in ants. I rushed to brush them all off and get out. 5 minutes later I got bit. It hurt.

Then I walked through another park called Satoshland. There was a petting zoo with goats and sheep and horses. I did not pet or feed them, but I did regard them. 

I looked at the map and realized that about a 40 minute walk away there was an onsen which are Japanese bathhouses. This one was also a public community center. I hadn't been to one yet and they were routinely recommended. I was hungry and this one had good food, so the reviews said. So there I went. 

My feet hurt and my stomach rumbled when I arrived. I ordered a dish off the menu with minimal comprehension. It turned out to be soba noodles and a chicken cutlet with a sweet omelet over rice. I inhaled it, except I didn't eat the rice. One of the problems I've run into here is not being hungry enough when I see something that looks delicious, so I decided to not waste calories on rice. 

Then I went for the baths. I had to ask what to do. The person at the desk pointed out that I'd need to buy a ticket and a towel from the coin machine. I think all together it cost 1000 Yen or less, less than 7 USD. 

I went in and immediately saw the most naked bodies I've ever seen. I stripped and joined the crowd. The element of Japanese culture where everyone keeps to themselves benefited me, because I did a few things wrong and accutely detected no one giving a shit. This is also one of those times where nearsightedness is a superpower.

I tried each hot tub. One was a normal amount of hot. Another was ridiculously hot, with steam sitting idly ontop. Another one I tried had an electric shock, "Denki Furo." Just a pulsing array of electrodes on the wall under the water. It surprised me, but in retrospect the signs on the walls with lightning bolts tried to warn me. My muscles twitched in weird ways with each pulse, but I gave it the college try and let it be weird for a while. Strange massage but not bad.

I washed myself and got out of there. I decided to head back south on the last train out of Sapporo station. I wasn't sure whether I'd hang in Tokyo or go south to Osaka, but I felt satisfied with my time in Hokkaido. If I came back to Hokkaido, I'd like to have a car to easily get to the volcanic national parks and remote beaches. They sounded amazing, but hard to get to by train.

I spent the night at a business hotel on the southern edge of Hokkaido, at the station that links the trains to the main island. It was pleasantly uneventful.
