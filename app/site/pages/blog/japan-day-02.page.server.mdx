Woke up at 7:30am to pick up a kind friend who drove me to the airport in exchange for using my car for the two weeks until they join me in Tokyo.

We got coffee, breakfast, and some snacks at Seattle's big coop supermarket, PCC. And on to the airport. 

We arrived 3 and a half hours early before my departure. That was too early, and I had to wait 30 minutes for the check-in counter to open. Then, the agents all came out in a line and took a bow together to welcome us and start their day. So maybe I was just on time.

Security was security. 

The flight left on time and I was on it.

The first snack was a Japanese rice cracker snack mix. 

First meal was tempura. There was rice, noodles, a salad, some edamame, rice pilaf. I think what I'm calling rice pilaf is actually pasta? It's the stuff that goes in orzo. Someone inform me. Finally there was a dollop of something creamy that I thought was boursin cheese but was definitely not. I couldn't identify it, even after tasting it.

I met a nice woman from China on the flight and we chatted about accounting and software and AI. She was on her way home for the first time since covid and was very excited about the local mushrooms in season which she missed.

On the flight, I read Network Effect by Martha Wells, I watched John Wick Chapter 4, and Marcel The Shell With Shoes On. All were awesome.

I also found the music. The Japanese music. I started with Gen Hoshino's Pop Virus album. There were only four songs: Pop Virus, one in Kanji, Family Song, and Hello Song. Pretty good.

The second snack came around. "KitKat For Cafe". I was guessing it was a normal KitKat, but the various KitKat flavors Japan offers were a topic of discussion with my friend this morning. I saved it for later so I'll have to update then on whether or not it was actually coffee flavored (update: it was).

I just realized that a danger of this travel log is that I write more about the boring parts like the flights than the interesting parts due to the excess energy and time the boredom affords me. Sorry.

I found live Tokyo television, the station NHK, on the screen in front of me. The broadcast seemed to be a competition show for boy bands singing pop songs in sparkly outfits. They seemed excited about their performance. A news flash came on which showed the temperature in Tokyo currently as 31 degrees Celcius. A bad storm had destroyed a bridge and messed up some houses. That's all I could understand from the images.

The flight landed and disembarked smoothly. Customs and border patrol were instant. And I was in Japan.

I stayed at the airport for about an hour to get coffee, buy a train card, and exchange cash. As I stood in line to exchange my money, a man ahead of me turned and told me that the counter across the way had a better exchange rate, and that he was only in this line because he had more than $2000 USD to exchange. He was right. I gave him my best "arigato gozaimasu".

The train was easy, not crowded, a quick 5 stops to my hotel. My first steps out of the train station I felt a wave of relief as I realized I had no more steps on the day-long journey. I was now a tourist in Japan, with no plans for two weeks. Everything I want to do from here on is a train ride or a bus ride or a walk away. 

I immediately almost walked into people. I don't understand the slight difference in the controlled chaos of walking a busy street here versus New York City, and I definitely can't describe it well. People default to walking on the left side, but also they generally just walk in a straight line and it just works. 

I checked into my hotel room. It had all the same stuff of an American hotel room but without any extra space. It was nice. I was grateful to not have too much stuff.

A card instructed me to turn on the TV to see the WiFi password. The first screen to greet me was white with faint gray text saying "Failed to load https://172...". I giggled. I turned off the TV and turned it back on and everything worked. 

I took a shower and did laundry in the sink. I hung everything up and went out to walk around. It was 5pm local time and I wanted to stay awake as long as possible. I walked around the three story shopping mall next door. I browsed a lot of shops but I only took my time in Uniqlo and the arcade. I wanted to buy pants and play video games, but I was too tired to make any decisions. 

I felt another wave of relief when I saw how easy it was to find anything I might need in the first shopping center I saw, and that I liked the look of the clothes. I had brought few clothes, and I wasn't sure about their usefulness in the Japanese summer. So now I had no anxiety about swapping my wardrobe. 

My feet and my brain were ready for bed, and I was happy I had stayed awake until 10pm. And then I looked at the clock again and it was only 8pm. Oh well. I went to my hotel room and passed out. I woke up at 2am.
