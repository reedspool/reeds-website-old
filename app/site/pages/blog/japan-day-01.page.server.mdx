Here I am, going to Japan.

My adventure began after my workday. I cleaned up the apartment. I ate what I could. Proud that my last meal in Portland was home-cooked, and that I trashed no food to leave for a month. 

Then I packed. First, a first for me, I laid out all of it on my floor. I photographed it all to post here and on Reddit (r/onebaggers). This is my first time flying with only a backpack. Okay, I cheated with the front pack as well. But no suitcase! I'm sure I'll miss some things, but I'll be in cities mostly, so I'm not worried about finding things I need. Maybe it will be hard to find clothing that fits. I'll find out soon, since I did not bring any pants (only a pair of shorts) and I feel I will want some to fit in with polite society.

I think I'll come home with a suitcase though. I plan to buy one in the latter two weeks and fill it with souvenirs. 

Anyway, this is a travel log, so I'm supposed to detail my day. 

Packing went quickly as I had so few items. Only now, at the end of a busy day, do I feel the wave of relief that it actually all fit in my one and a half bags. I made my list a week ago, but I never tested my assumption.

The bags together, all packed, weigh exactly 10 pounds.

Then I dropped my key off with some friends who graciously offered to water my plants. I said a quick good-bye and got in my car to head to Seattle. 

The direct flights all left from Seattle, which is only a 3 hour drive from Portland. That sounded much easier than a 21 hour layover in Hawaii, and the other wild options. The flight is 10 hours long, and departs at noon tomorrow.

My drive was deathly hot. A really bad crash compounded with July 4th weekend traffic to slow my pace to a crawl 5 minutes outside of Portland. My car's air conditioning was out of commission. It was 83 degrees outside, but felt much hotter on the asphalt. I drank plenty of water and survived (spoiler alert).

I stopped for gas in Puyallup and ate pupusas at a Salvadorean restaurant.

Seattle is still gorgeous. A bed was open for me, as an old friend had left that morning for the east coast. I'm lucky and grateful to have such a friend, and also lucky for the timing.

My final act on day -1 was to walk along the water in Fremont, stretch, and prepare for a long day of sitting on a plane.
