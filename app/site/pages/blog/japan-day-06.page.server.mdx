I woke up, showered, and did my laundry in the coin op machine convenienly placed right next to my room.

I checked out 20 minutes before my train arrived at the station across the street. For most trains, one must get a ticket with a reserved seat, even with the rail pass. This  station lacked the self-serve terminals of the bigger stations, so I had to ask at the counter. They got me a ticket in 5 minutes, so I had 10 minutes to wander around the block. I looked for coffee, but only found the common vending machines. So I got a can of "Georgia" coffee. 

The lady at the station poked her head out to wonder where I was, if I was going to make it. She helpfully pointed me to exactly where to stand for my assigned seat. 

The train ride had pleasant views of the water on one side and the small mountains poking into the clouds on the other.

I walked in on a man peeing on the train for the second time in two days.

I got off the train at 1pm without any food in me. I went straight for the food court advertised in the basement of the shopping center attached to the train station. I had an awesome, cheap meal of vegetable tempura and udon with beef. It was too much food, though it was delicious and under ten dollars. 

Then I went up to the arcade in the same shopping center and  played some new games. One was a drumming game on plastic traditional Japanese drums, miniatures of the same I saw at the Meiji shrine. I was terrible at it, and then I walked around the corner and saw a teenager acing the hardest difficulty with sticks he had brought from home. 

The new fad I recognized were games where you bought trading cards or chips with RFIDs in them, then placed them on the surface of the machine and slid them around to make moves. There was a Pokemon one, an Ultraman one, a Dragonball one, and a Gundam one. They're all internet connected, so you battle other people around the country in other shopping mall arcades.

I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I picked a random park on the map and went to the bus terminal. But the bus closed its doors right as I approached, and the next one wasn't for an hour, so I decided to go to the big long strip park Odori nearby. I sat on a bench and rested a while. Then it began to rain and I didn't have any rain gear. I went down into the underground shopping mall and browsed. This brought me to another famous strip, Susukino. I wandered around, got ramen in a shop where one orders via a coin machine which spits out a receipt to hand to the cook. I found another arcade and sat to play a game where you operate a train on a Japanese metro line. I was terrible at it. But it was a relaxing way to spend a half hour and 5USD. 

Exhausted, I looked for a hotel nearby, and they were all too expensive except the capsule hotels. I wasn't in the mood for a hostel experience, especially given the area was a hotspot for drinking tourists. I struggled to book a hotel online for a while, and finally decided ot just walk into some and ask if they had a room. Luckily this worked and I found a reasonable room at the train station for 135USD. 

The room was comfortable, and I read a bit before I slept.
