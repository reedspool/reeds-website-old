# Documentation How-To

[Back to Docs Home](README.md)

Herein are rules and instructions for maintaining and writing new entries in this documentation.

## Make a New Top-Level Documentation File

1. First, if this documentation only pertains to one lib or app, [follow those instructions instead](docs-not-yet-implemented.md).
2. Determine an appropriate file name. Review the [existing pattern of file names](./) to see if there is a category under which this new file fits.
3. Copy the file [Documentation Template](docs-template.md) to the chosen file-name.
4. Edit all the places with a `<--` note.
5. Add a link and high-level description of the new document in the [Docs Home page](README.md).
6. Add links to the new document in other docs in the project. Put the link in the context of a complete sentence.
