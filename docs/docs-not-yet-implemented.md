# Not Yet Implemented

[Back to Docs Home](README.md)

You clicked on a link which has no target yet. I apologize for deceiving you. I hope this was a better experience than GitHub's 404 page, despite the lack of [Jedi Octocat](a-page-that-really-does-not-exist.md).

A link to this page may also indicate a feature which is not yet implemented, but for which implementation is planned.

I find it useful to write checks which I cannot cash to compel myself to invest.
